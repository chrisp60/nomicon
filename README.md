Implementing various types and collections from the Rust stdlib.

Worked through using various resources.

- [Rustnomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/).
- [Jon Gjengset's wonderful youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo).
- [Rust stdlib](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/), for ideas and hints on
  implementations.
- [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).
- [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html).

The goal is to learn about `unsafe` Rust and data structures.

## Collections

- [-] `crate::Vec`.

## Interior Mutability & Reference Counts

- [X] `Cell`
- [X] `RefCell`
- [ ] `Rc`
- [ ] `Arc`
- [ ] `Mutex`
- [ ] `RwLock`

## Async

- [ ] Local Executor (`!Send + !Sync`).
